# Solution

- First part can be seen by just opening `pdf`.
- Immediately, we can see that the first few bytes say `PNG`, this is the PNG file header. This tells us that our PDF file is actually a PNG file. You can read more about PNG file headers [here](https://medium.com/@0xwan/png-structure-for-beginner-8363ce2a9f73).

- So, when we rename this flag2of2-final.png, we get the another half of the flag

- `picoCTF{f1u3n7_1n_pn9_&_pdf_249d05c0}`
